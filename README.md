# Side-Projects
This repository holds all of the projects related to the Media Ministry Manager ***(M3App)*** project that I have taken up as a Software Developer since graduation in 2018.
I wanted to upload these to GitHub so that it can become a part of my portfolio. Most of
this is an ongoing work in progress that has been deployed to and is in use by the people that requested them, currentlly being used to manage around 300 users.

# M3App
This project is the Desktop Application that I created to aid in managing their business
of selling Media Ministry products. A list of items being managed by this software are:

  * Sermon CDs
  * Study Guides
  * Collection Sets and more
    
The performance of the application is a constant work in progress as I learn better ways to attack certain problems and challenges.

# M3App MOBILE
This project holds the mobile version of M3App. For this project I had to make an RESTful API of my own, because
to interact with my SQL Database that I have setup. This application has been placed on a small hold as I figure out better ways to create the application.

# M3App API
This is my custom RESTful API that I made for all of the M3App implementations. This was made with the help of the Microsoft API
tutorial however all of the functions are for the purpose of my application. This project has been deprecated in favor of using a Node.js and Express based API instead. I want to keep this project here for the time being for showing growth in API development.

# M3App SETUP
This is a project that was created to have an easier time installing and updating the desktop application. This was something being explored to see if this was a viable option for installs instead of relying on ClickOnce Installer.
